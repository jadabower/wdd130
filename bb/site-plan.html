        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/606c38-283618-fefae0-dda15e-bc6c25" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/606c38-283618-fefae0-dda15e-bc6c25</a>

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h2>

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The Home page should include a description of the service that the website provides. It should be something like this:
        Sometimes, as a Minecraft player, it can be difficult to bring to life the grand ideas you have for a build. Especially when you have the absolute perfect spot for something, and don't want to waste a perfect opportunity on a dirt house. That's why we here at Beautifully Blocky decided that this building process should not be stressful, and we are here to help you with all your builds. Just click "Get Building" above and fill out the form describing your dream build. Our builders will work on a build specifically for your world, and they will respond in 5 to 7 business days with pictures of the build as well as a list of resources the build requires. This service is completely free. Check out the "Build Gallery" page to see some of the builds we have done for users like you. Also be sure to follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Contact us through beautifully_blocky@fakemail.com or call (415) 523-0057. Thank you for coming to us for all your building needs. Go build something beautiful!
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Build Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        The Build Gallery page should include several artfully placed pictures along with a description of what the user asked for to get that build. 
        Some of the builds I could include could be the mushroom house I built (description: House themed around mushrooms, cabin in the woods, earthy, magical, cozy), the windmill I build (description: large white windmill in a wheat field), the house I built on the cliff-side (description: Small cabin on the cliff. Block palate: pink glass, oxidized copper, spruce wood, diorite, calcite), the switch house I built (description: I want a house that looks like a Nintendo Switch playing Minecraft against the hillside. I have a pink and a blue joy-con), the totem shop I built (description: I want a marble shop with pixel art of a totem of undying on the outside). 
        I don't know how many builds I will actually want to include here but this should be good.

      </ul>
      <h3>Get Building</h3>
      <p>
        The Get Building page should include a form with several input boxes like "World Seed", "X-Coordinate", "Y-Coordinate", and "Z-Coordinate". It should also have a box to put a description of what build style/size/type of building they want, any restrictions of materials they have, and a color or build palate. They could also choose between whether they want a fully complete build or just a structure with no details or something like that. They can also input either their phone number or email so that we can send the finished product.
